# Callie Briscoe's Website Verision 2
This is a expansive site with a main page view, a blog and an admin controller side. Once done, it will be a complete project with the PHP MVC Laravel framework on the back-end and a Bootstrap, Blade, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and JQuery. It can hold mulitpule users but functions as my profolio. It has Models and Respositories, authication, faker data, testers, email capability and much more. I will be hosting this website on AWS and I am using the agile methodology when making commits to GitHub.
